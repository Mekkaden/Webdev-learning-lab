# Webdev Learning Lab

This repository contains the code I write while learning web development, mainly focused on the MERN stack.

The purpose of this repo is to track my learning progress, practice concepts, and build consistency with Git and GitHub. It includes small experiments, practice files, and concept-based code rather than polished, production-ready projects.

## What this repo contains
- Frontend basics (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- JavaScript fundamentals and DOM manipulation
- Async/await and fetch API practice
- Backend basics using Node.js and Express (as I progress)
- Small learning exercises and demos

## Note
This repository is meant for learning and experimentation.
Larger or complete projects will be moved to separate repositories once they are properly built and documented.

## Why this exists
- To stay consistent with coding
- To document what I’m learning
- To get comfortable with Git and GitHub workflows
